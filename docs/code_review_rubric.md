## Tips for Success

1. **Practice your demo** - Make sure it runs reliably before the review
2. **Know your code** - Be able to find and explain any part of your implementation
3. **Prepare for all questions** - Review the full question list in the README
4. **Use concrete examples** - Reference specific code, documents, or test results
5. **Explain your reasoning** - "Why" is as important as "what"
