# Activity 4: Reflection - The Evolution of Your AI Assistant

In this activity, you'll reflect on how A4 compares to earlier assignments and what you've learned about shaping AI behavior.

## Memory: Multi-turn Conversation

In earlier assignments, each prompt started fresh - the model had no memory of previous interactions.

**How did multi-turn conversation change your interaction with the AI?**

**What became possible that wasn't before?**

**Provide a specific example from your research session where conversation history mattered:**

## Grounding: RAG and Document Retrieval

Earlier, the model answered from its training data alone. Now it has access to the Federalist Papers through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

**How did having access to specific documents change the quality of responses?**

REPLACE_ME

**How did it change the nature of the interaction?**

REPLACE_ME

**Were there tradeoffs? Did RAG ever make things worse or more limited?**

## Shaping Behavior: Tools, Prompts, and Retrieval

You've now experienced multiple ways to shape AI behavior:
- **Tools (A3)**: Giving the AI new capabilities (like math calculation)
- **System Prompts (A2, A4)**: Setting persona, task, and behavioral guidelines (introduced in A2, explored further in A4's RAG context)
- **Retrieval (A4)**: Grounding the AI in specific documents

**Which of these do you think has the biggest impact on AI behavior? Why?**

**Which gives the user the most control over the AI's behavior?**

## Looking Forward

**What would you add to this system to make it an even better research assistant?**

REPLACE_ME

**What are the limitations of keyword-based search (BM25) that you observed?**

REPLACE_ME

**How might semantic search (understanding meaning, not just keywords) improve the experience?**
